# Abnormal-Activity-Detection-Deep-Learning
Abnormal Activity Detection using Deep Learning LRCN is a model that combines CNN and RNN to identify abnormal behavior in videos. With reduced layers, resized frames, and augmented datasets, it achieves an 82% accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications like surveillance and anomaly detection.
